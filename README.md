# LiteracyPro
## Test for LiteracyPro - Uses PHP with Laravel

This project was created using php 7.1.4 and Laravel 5. I used the built in laravel server ('php artisan server') to run most of my code. For best results, use the latest version of Chrome though it should work fine on most browsers.

For Task #2:

The tables as an EAV model would look like such:

```
